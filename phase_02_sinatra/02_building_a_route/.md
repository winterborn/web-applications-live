# Building a Route

Learn to build a route to respond to HTTP requests.

## Routing

Remember that a web server receives HTTP requests, execute some code depending on the received request, and returns a response.

To decide on what code to execute depending on the request, internally Sinatra keeps a "routing" table, which associates a given request **method and path** to a block of Ruby code:

| Method | Path | Ruby code                          |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET    | /    | `# some code to execute`           |
| POST   | /    | `# some different code to execute` |

Different requests will execute different code in our Sinatra application, and lead to different responses being sent back.

Here is an example of a minimal Sinatra application, configuring a single **route**:

```ruby
# file: app.rb
require "sinatra/base"
require "sinatra/reloader"

class Application < Sinatra::Base
  # This allows the app code to refresh
  # without having to restart the server.
  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end

  # Declares a route that responds to a request with:
  #  - a GET method
  #  - the path /
  get "/" do
    # The code here is executed when a request is received,
    # and need to send a response.

    # We can simply return a string which
    # will be used as the response content.
    # Unless specified, the response status code
    # will be 200 (OK).
    return "Some response data"
  end
end
```

The Ruby block between the `do` and `end` associated with a method and path is called a "route" or "route block". The code in this block is executed _only_ is the received request matches the method and path.

When Sinatra received a request, it looks through all the route blocks configured in that class, and execute the code of the first one matching the request.

```ruby
# Example when Sinatra receives a request
# GET /

class Application < Sinatra::Base
  # ...

  post "/" do
    # This route is not executed (the method doesn't match).
  end

  get "/hello" do
    # This route is not executed (the path doesn't match).
  end

  get "/" do
    # This route matches! The code inside the block will be executed now.
  end

  get "/" do
    # This route matches too, but will not be executed.
    # Only the first one matching (above) is.
  end
end
```

_In the following sections, we will use the shorthand notation `GET /some_path` to designate a route which responds to `GET` requests to the path `/some_path`._

## Accessing request parameters

We can use the `params` hash inside a route block to access the request _query parameters._

If a client sends a request with a query parameter with key `name` and value `David`, this parameter will be present in the `params` hash, and we can access the value like this:

```ruby
# Request:
# GET /?name=David

get "/" do
  name = params[:name] # The value is 'David'

  # Do something with `name`...

  return "Hello #{name}"
end
```

We can also use `params` to retrieve _body parameters_ sent with `POST` request â€” it works exactly the same way.

```ruby
# Request:
# POST /hello
#   With body parameter: name=Alice

post "/hello" do
  name = params[:name] # The value is 'Alice'

  # Do something with `name`...

  return "Hello #{name}"
end
```
