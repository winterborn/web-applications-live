Learn to deploy an application using Heroku.

## Intro

It is now time to deploy your application so it runs remotely. Remember that this is how web server programs work in real-world situations: they run on a remote machine, and clients access it through the network, using HTTP requests and responses.

In this section, you will use Heroku, which is a Cloud service allowing us to deploy programs without too much configuration and work. It has a limited free tier you can use for simple projects.

First, [you'll need to create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login). Then follow the steps below.

## Installing the Heroku CLI

If you're on Mac, you can run the following command to install the CLI. Otherwise, [follow the instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) for your own system.

```bash
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

## Project Setup

Create a new account on Heroku if you don't have one, and go to [your applications](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) page.

Create a new application. Choose a unique name (such as `my-sinatra-app-{your-name}`) and leave the default region.

```bash
$ cd my-web-project/

# Skip the git setup if already done.
$ git init
$ git branch -m main

# Login into heroku
# This will automatically open a page in your web browser
# to login using Heroku's website. Once it's done, you can
# go back to your terminal.
$ heroku login

# Create an heroku app
$ heroku create
# This command will modify Gemfile.lock - make sure to
# 'git add' it again if needed.
$ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux

# Add files and commit
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Web application setup"

# Push and deploy to heroku
$ git push heroku main

# Heroku will then output a bunch of logs
# while deploying.

# It should give you the URL of your deployed app
# once finished (for example, https://young-tundra-27419.herokuapp.com)
```

## Using a PostgreSQL Database on Heroku

You can configure your Heroku application so it uses a database, also hosted by Heroku.

```bash
# This adds an Heroku addon to your application, with the
# 'hobby-dev' plan, which is the basic free Heroku plan.
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

# This will launch a psql REPL connected
# to the remote Heroku database. Once you're
# in this REPL, you can load the SQL structure
# and seeds of your tables by copy pasting the SQL
# code in there.
$ heroku pg:psql
```

Heroku automatically sets an environment variable when running the app, which contains the connection string to the database we need to use. Modify the `DatabaseConnection` class so it connects to the right database.

```ruby
# file: lib/database_connection.rb

def self.connect
  # If the environment variable (set by Heroku)
  # is present, use this to open the connection.
  if ENV["DATABASE_URL"] != nil
    @connection = PG.connect(ENV["DATABASE_URL"])
    return
  end

  if ENV["ENV"] == "test"
    database_name = "music_library_test"
  else
    database_name = "music_library"
  end
  @connection = PG.connect({ host: "127.0.0.1", dbname: database_name })
end
```

You can now commit your changes to the file, and run again `git push heroku main` to redeploy the app.

## Exercise

Deploy your previous challenge project to a new Heroku app.
