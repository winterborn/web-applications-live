# Using forms

## Intro

A form is used to send a `POST` request, usually with some additional data, as request parameters.

A form is usually implemented over two routes:

- The first one, a `GET` route, only returns an HTML page with the form, so the user can fill in and submit it.
- The second one, a `POST` route, handles the body parameters sent by the browser, and returns a response (usually to indicate whether the form data has been successfully handled or saved).

Here's an example:

```ruby
get "/posts/new" do
  # This route doesn't do much,
  # it returns the view with the HTML form.
  return erb(:new_post)
end

post "/posts" do
  # Get request body parameters
  title = params[:title]
  content = params[:content]

  # Do something useful, like creating a post
  # in a database.
  new_post = Post.new
  new_post.title = title
  new_post.content = content
  PostRepository.new.create(new_post)

  # Return a view to confirm
  # the form submission or resource creation
  # to the user.
  return erb(:post_created)
end
```

## HTML forms

Like links, we can use forms to make the browser send an HTTP request.

```html
<form action="/posts" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="title" />
  <input type="text" name="content" />

  <input type="submit" value="Submit the form" />
</form>
```

When the user submits this form, the browser sends a `POST` request to the path `/posts`. The `action` and `method` attributes are used to tell the browser which method and path to send the new request to. The content of each form input is sent as body parameters.

## Validation

Note that the values of the `name` attributes in the HTML form must match the parameters' names the Sinatra route expects — this is also called having a "contract" between the client (the web browser sending the form data) and the server (our Sinatra application, which is expecting some specific parameters).

A way of enforcing this contract, and avoiding the client to send wrong values, is to add some validation to the `POST` route — here's an example:

```ruby
# app.rb

post "/posts" do
  if invalid_request_parameters?
    # Set the response code
    # to 400 (Bad Request) - indicating
    # to the client it sent incorrect data
    # in the request.
    status 400

    return ""
  end

  # Parameters are valid,
  # the rest of the route can execute.
end

def invalid_request_parameters?
  params[:title] == nil || params[:content] == nil
end
```

## Test-driving a form

Since there are two routes, we need to test-drive these two routes. It's fine to test-drive them one by one.

```ruby
context "GET /posts/new" do
  it "returns the form page" do
    response = get("/posts/new")

    expect(response.status).to eq(200)
    expect(response.body).to include("<h1>Add a post</h1>")

    # Assert we have the correct form tag with the action and method.
    expect(response.body).to include('<form action="/posts" method="POST">')

    # We can assert more things, like having
    # the right HTML form inputs, etc.
  end
end

context "POST /posts" do
  it "returns a success page" do
    # We're now sending a POST request,
    # simulating the behaviour that the HTML form would have.
    response = post("/posts", title: "Welcome", content: "I am a post")

    expect(response.status).to eq(200)
    expect(response.body).to include("<p>Your post has been added!</p>")
  end

  it "responds with 400 status if parameters are invalid" do
    # ...
  end
end
```

## On Route Priority

Remember that Sinatra uses the first route that matches a request. When creating a route such as `/albums/new`, a common problem you could run into would be to have another route `/albums/:id`, containing a dynamic path parameter, being used - as the parameter `:id` will "capture" the value `"new"` in the URL.

```ruby
# For a request with path `/albums/new`

# This route will be used - which is probably not what we want.
get "/albums/:id" do
end

# And this one is skipped
get "/albums/new" do
end
```

An easy way to fix this is to define the routes in the reverse order - this way `/albums/new` will be used first, and then any request to a path such as `/albums/12` will get to the other route. Another way, a bit more complex, is [to configure the route parameter to match a certain format](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html#:~:text=Route%20matching%20with%20Regular%20Expressions%3A), such as a numeric value.
