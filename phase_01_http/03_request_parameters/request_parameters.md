Request Parameters
The GET method is often used to query or retrieve information from the server. The exact data returned depends of the implementation of the web server.

A GET request can also contain query parameters, as part of the URL.

The POST method is often used to send data to the web server (usually to create or update data, or just send some information). What is done with this data depends of the implementation of the web server.

A POST request can also contain body parameters. Contrarily to query parameters, they are not included in the URL, but within the request body itself.

There are more HTTP methods, but we'll cover them a bit later.
